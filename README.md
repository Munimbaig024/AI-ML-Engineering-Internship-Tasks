## 📋 Overview
This project showcases several classic and practical tasks:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Iris dataset
- **Stock price prediction** using Apple (AAPL) data
- **Heart disease prediction** from medical records
- **A simple medical Q&A chatbot** using the Gemini API
- **House price prediction** with the Ames Housing dataset

Each task is in its own folder with code, data, and results.
