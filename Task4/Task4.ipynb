      "A: Oh, a sore throat is such a common problem!  There are actually many things that can cause it.  Sometimes it's a simple viral infection, like a cold or the flu.  Other times, it could be due to bacteria, allergies, or even irritation from dry air, or something like acid reflux.  Even straining your voice can do it!\n",
      "\n",
      "If your sore throat is severe, lasts a long time, or is accompanied by other symptoms like a high fever, difficulty swallowing, or a rash, it's really important to see a doctor to get it checked out. They can help figure out exactly what's going on and recommend the best course of action.\n",

      "A: Paracetamol can be used to reduce fever and relieve pain in children, but it's really important to use it correctly.  The safe dosage varies greatly depending on the child's age and weight.  **Never give a child paracetamol without first checking with their doctor or pharmacist to determine the appropriate dose.**  They can advise you on the correct amount to give your child based on their individual needs.  Giving the wrong dose can be harmful, so it's crucial to get professional guidance.  If you have any concerns about your child's fever or pain, or if you're unsure about using paracetamol, please consult a doctor or other healthcare professional immediately.\n",

      "\n",
      "Q: Can I take antibiotics for a cold?\n",
      "A: Hi there!  It's great that you're thinking about your health.  Antibiotics are powerful medicines that fight bacterial infections.  Colds, however, are usually caused by viruses.  Taking antibiotics for a cold won't help and could even lead to problems like antibiotic resistance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For cold symptoms like a runny nose, cough, and sore throat, plenty of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medications like pain relievers can often help.  If your symptoms are severe, or if they don't improve after a week or so, it's a good idea to see your doctor to make sure everything is okay. They can properly assess your situation and recommend the best course of action.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are some things you can try to improve your sleep, like making sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.  Sticking to a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends, can also help.  Regular exercise can be beneficial, but avoid intense workouts close to bedtime.  A relaxing bedtime routine, like taking a warm bath or reading a book, might also help you wind down.  And of course, limiting caffeine and alcohol before bed is a good idea.\n",

    "## Medical Q&A Bot with Gemini API: Results & Final Thoughts\n",
    "### What Was Done\n",
    "- Goal: Build a simple medical question-answering assistant using the free Gemini API (since GPT API access wasn’t available).\n",
    "- Setup: Installed and configured the Gemini SDK, set up the API key, and loaded the Gemini 1.5 model.\n",
    "- Functionality: Created a function to send user health questions to the Gemini model, with a prompt that makes the bot friendly, cautious, and always recommends seeing a doctor for serious issues.\n",
    "- Testing: Asked the bot several sample medical questions (e.g., about sore throats, paracetamol for children, antibiotics for colds, and insomnia). The bot gave clear, safe, and helpful answers, always encouraging users to consult a healthcare professional for serious or specific concerns.\n",
    "- User Interaction: Implemented a simple loop for users to ask their own questions and get instant responses from the bot.\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "- Strengths: The bot provides friendly, easy-to-understand, and safe health information. It avoids giving risky advice and always suggests seeing a doctor when needed.\n",
    "- Limitations: The free Gemini model may not be as advanced as paid APIs, and it can’t give personalized medical advice or diagnoses.\n",
    "- Practical Use: This kind of assistant is great for general health questions and raising awareness, but it’s not a substitute for professional medical care.\n",
